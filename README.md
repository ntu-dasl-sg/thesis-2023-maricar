# Maricar Rabonza's PhD dissertation:

This repository contains the LaTeX files used to compile my thesis dissertation submitted to the Asian School of the Environment, NTU, Singapore.
It already follows the ASE NTU template.

If you're using Overleaf, just download the files here, compress them into a .rar file, then upload to Overleaf. It works well with the pdfLaTeX compiler.
I'll make an Overleaf template version of this soon.


## Versions available:

* Version 1 - Submitted to NTU at January 17, 2023
* Overleaf template version : "PhD Thesis_NTU Singapore_Asian School of the Environment (Unofficial).zip"
