# Maricar Rabonza's PhD dissertation:

This repository contains the LaTeX files used to compile my thesis dissertation submitted to the Asian School of the Environment, NTU, Singapore.
It already follows the ASE NTU template.

If you're using Overleaf, just download the files here, compress them into a .rar file, then upload to Overleaf.
I'll make an Overleaf template version of this soon.


## Versions available:

* Version 1 - Submitted to NTU at January 17, 2023
