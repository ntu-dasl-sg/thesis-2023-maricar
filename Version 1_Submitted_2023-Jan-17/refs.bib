abstract = "A plinian-style eruption with a radially spreading umbrella cloud occurred on February 13, 2014, at Kelud volcano, Indonesia. We present the sequence of this plinian event based on a geological survey of the eruption products and analysis of satellite images. The eruptive deposits were divided into four major depositional units (Units A, B, C, and D) and used to determine the sequence of events. The plinian phase was preceded by partial destruction of the existing lava dome and generation of high-energy pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) mainly toward the NE that produced a series of depositional subunits (Units A0–2) and blown-down trees (stage 1). In the main phase of the plinian eruption, tephra fallout (Unit B) was widely distributed over East Java (stage 2). The winds above the volcano significantly affected the tephra dispersal process. In stage 3, the plinian column collapsed, generating dense PDCs that flowed down the volcano valleys, producing pumiceous lobate deposits (Unit C). The declining phase of the eruption produced fine-rich fallout tephra layers (Unit D1–2) from low-level eruption plumes and/or ash lofted from PDCs. The eruption sequence constructed from field observations is supported by geophysical observations. The deposit features and componentry suggest that newly ascended magma triggered the destruction of the lava dome and the generation of high-energy PDCs, and during the subsequent climactic phase the dome was completely destroyed. We estimate a total erupted volume of 0.25–0.50km3 (bulk deposit volume, 0.14–0.28km3 in dense rock equivalent) and a mass eruption rate of 6.5±2.8×107kg/s, with a volcanic explosivity index of 4. The eruption sequence and physical parameters of the 2014 eruption will help assess future volcanic activity and hazards at Kelud volcano."

For example, at a certain time point we say that these data follow or come from the normal or exponential probability distribution. One of the important questions then is whether observed data are representative or follow a particular probability distribution. In fact, there is nothing we can do parametrically or statistically unless through goodness-of-fit testing identify the probability density functions, pdf, that probabilistically characterizes the behavior of the given data, the phenomenon of interest.}

abstract = {A simple semianalytical model to simulate ash dispersion and deposition produced by sustained Plinian and sub-Plinian eruption columns based on the 2D advection–dispersion equation was applied. The eruption column acts as a vertical line source with a given mass distribution and neglects the complex dynamics within the eruption column. Thus, the use of the model is limited to areas far from the vent where the dynamics of the eruption column play a minor role. Vertical wind and diffusion components are considered negligible with respect to the horizontal ones. The dispersion and deposition of particles in the model is only governed by gravitational settling, horizontal eddy diffusion, and wind advection. The model accounts for different types and size classes of a user-defined number of particle classes and changing settling velocity with altitude. In as much as wind profiles are considered constant on the entire domain, the model validity is limited to medium-range distances (about 30–200 km away from the source). The model was used to reconstruct the tephra fall deposit from the documented Plinian eruption of Mt. Vesuvius, Italy, in 79 A.D. In this case, the model was able to broadly reproduce the characteristic medium-range tephra deposit. The results support the validity of the model, which has the advantage of being simple and fast to compute. It has the potential to serve as a simple tool for predicting the distribution of ash fall of hypothetical or real eruptions of a given magnitude and a given wind profile. Using a statistical set of frequent wind profiles, it also was used to construct air fall hazard maps of the most likely affected areas around active volcanoes where a large eruption is expected to occur.}

The model was developed simplifying the advection–diffusion–sedimentation equation for volcanic ash transport in the atmosphere from three to two dimensions and using a semi-analytical computational method to greatly reduce the required computer time and memory. hazmap can be used either to simulate the mass distribution of the deposit if a wind profile is given (“deposit mode”), or to define the probability of a given accumulation of mass on the ground if a statistical set of wind profiles is provided (“probability mode”). The model needs the definition of the physical system (spatial distribution of the point sources, total erupted mass, settling velocity distribution, wind velocity profile, atmospheric turbulent diffusion coefficients), and of a computational grid. The output values of mass accumulation on the ground or the probability of mass accumulation are computed on a regular grid, suitable for further analysis.}

@article{bonna2005,
	Abstract = {On 17 June 1996, Ruapehu volcano, New Zealand, produced a sustained andesitic sub-Plinian eruption, which generated a narrow tephra-fall deposit extending more than 200 km from the volcano. The extremely detailed data set from this eruption allowed methods for the determination of total grain-size distribution and volume of tephra-fall deposits to be critically investigated. Calculated total grain-size distributions of tephra-fall deposits depend strongly on the method used and on the availability of data across the entire dispersal area. The Voronoi Tessellation method was tested for the Ruapehu deposit and gave the best results when applied to a data set extending out to isomass values of <1 g m−2. The total grain-size distribution of a deposit is also strongly influenced by the very proximal samples, and this can be shown by artificially constructing subsets from the Ruapehu database. Unless the available data set is large, all existing techniques for calculations of total grain-size distribution give only apparent distributions. The tephra-fall deposit from Ruapehu does not show a simple exponential thinning, but can be approximated well by at least three straight-line segments or by a power-law fit on semi-log plots of thickness vs. (area)1/2. Integrations of both fits give similar volumes of about 4×106 m3. Integration of at least three exponential segments and of a power-law fit with at least ten isopach contours available can be considered as a good estimate of the actual volume of tephra fall. Integrations of smaller data sets are more problematic.},

abstract = {The majority of research on efficient and scalable algorithms in computational science and engineering has focused on the forward problem: given parameter inputs, solve the governing equations to determine output quantities of interest. In contrast, here we consider the broader question: given a (large-scale) model containing uncertain parameters, (possibly) noisy observational data, and a prediction quantity of interest, how do we construct efficient and scalable algorithms to (1) infer the model parameters from the data (the deterministic inverse problem), (2) quantify the uncertainty in the inferred parameters (the Bayesian inference problem), and (3) propagate the resulting uncertain parameters through the model to issue predictions with quantified uncertainties (the forward uncertainty propagation problem)? We present efficient and scalable algorithms for this end-to-end, data-to-prediction process under the Gaussian approximation and in the context of modeling the flow of the Antarctic ice sheet and its effect on loss of grounded ice to the ocean. The ice is modeled as a viscous, incompressible, creeping, shear-thinning fluid. The observational data come from satellite measurements of surface ice flow velocity, and the uncertain parameter field to be inferred is the basal sliding parameter, represented by a heterogeneous coefficient in a Robin boundary condition at the base of the ice sheet. The prediction quantity of interest is the present-day ice mass flux from the Antarctic continent to the ocean. We show that the work required for executing this data-to-prediction process—measured in number of forward (and adjoint) ice sheet model solves—is independent of the state dimension, parameter dimension, data dimension, and the number of processor cores. The key to achieving this dimension independence is to exploit the fact that, despite their large size, the observational data typically provide only sparse information on model parameters. This property can be exploited to construct a low rank approximation of the linearized parameter-to-observable map via randomized SVD methods and adjoint-based actions of Hessians of the data misfit functional.}

abstract = {Abstract The February 2014 eruption of Kelud volcano (Indonesia) destroyed most of the instruments near it. We use remote seismic and infrasound sensors to reconstruct the eruptive sequence. The first explosions were relatively weak seismic and infrasound events. A major stratospheric ash injection occurred a few minutes later and produced long-lasting atmospheric and ground-coupled acoustic waves that were detected as far as 11,000 km by infrasound sensors and up to 2300 km away on seismometers. A seismic event followed ∼12 minutes later and was recorded 7000 km away by seismometers. We estimate a volcanic intensity around 10.9, placing the 2014 Kelud eruption between the 1980 Mount St. Helens and 1991 Pinatubo eruptions intensities. We demonstrate how remote infrasound and seismic sensors are critical for the early detection of volcanic explosions, and how they can help to constrain and understand eruptive sequences.},

Its key strengths are rapid and remote detection, because the radio signals produced by lightning can propagate thousands of km at the speed of light. Despite these tantalizing properties, the scientific work on volcanic lightning has only recently started gaining momentum. Much more is needed to understand what lightning reveals about the evolution of an eruption in near-real time. Here we examine the timing and energy release of lightning generated by the eruption of Kelud volcano in Indonesia on 13 February 2014, as detected by the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN). The eruption column reached at least 26 km above sea level, representing the highest plume since the advent of global lightning networks in the last decade. Therefore, it provides valuable constraints on the electrification of end-member, sustained Plinian columns. We investigate the lightning in context with satellite images, photographs, and other published studies. Results show that the earliest satellite-detected activity was a thermal anomaly at ~15:46 UTC, corresponding to a directed blast at the onset of eruption (and only a few lightning strokes). Following a brief pause, the eruption produced a sustained column and umbrella cloud that spread outward into the tropical stratosphere. Rates of umbrella expansion provide an average mass eruption rate (MER) in the range of 8 × 107–1 × 108 kg s−1. A more nuanced picture emerges from the time-varying MERs (determined between each satellite pass), which show rapid intensification during the first hour of eruption, followed by constant MER for about an hour, and waning toward the end (after ~17:50 UTC). At this stage, decreasing flux into the umbrella cloud coincides with column instability and formation of pyroclastic density currents, as recorded by photos from the ground ~17:45 UTC. We infer that some of the erupted mass partitioned into ground-hugging currents, leading to a lower apparent MER. Interestingly, there is not a 1:1 correlation between lightning intensity and MER over the course of eruption. Stroke rates increase sharply within the first 30–40 min (during rapid intensification of the plume), and then drop below 2 strokes per min once the MER remains constant. This suggests that electrification was controlled by the rate of increase in MER—in other words, the acceleration of particles out of the vent. We also show that lightning stroke-rates and energies are greatest within 50 km of the vent, even when the ash cloud extends >200 km downwind, indicating that lightning was focused in the regions of highest particle concentration and turbulence. Overall, we conclude that abrupt changes in lightning rates are clearly linked to changes in eruption behavior, and that rapid detection could aid monitoring efforts to characterize eruption rates or styles.}

abstract = {Using a three-dimensional fluid dynamic model for eruption cloud dynamics, we present numerical simulations of the development of a volcanic eruption column and umbrella cloud formed during the 13 February 2014 eruptions of Mount Kelud, Indonesia. The model used in this study quantitatively reproduces the observed data and, in particular, the plume height and the horizontal expansion level and rate of the umbrella cloud. The simulation results suggest that on the basis of the plume height and structures and the horizontal expansion level of the umbrella cloud the mass eruption rate (MER) for the 2014 Kelud eruptions was 3×107 to 4×107kgs−1. On the basis of the horizontal expansion rate of the umbrella cloud, on the other hand, the estimated MER was 1×108kgs−1. The difference between these two estimates implies the strong diffusion in the umbrella cloud or the efficient entrainment of ambient air by eruption column.}

abstract = {Spaceborne digital elevation models (DEMs) are a fundamental input for many geoscience studies, but they still include nonnegligible height errors. Here we introduce a high-accuracy global DEM at 3″ resolution ($\sim$90 m at the equator) by eliminating major error components from existing DEMs. We separated absolute bias, stripe noise, speckle noise, and tree height bias using multiple satellite data sets and filtering techniques. After the error removal, land areas mapped with ±2m or better vertical accuracy were increased from 39\% to 58\%. Significant improvements were found in flat regions where height errors larger than topography variability, and landscapes such as river networks and hill-valley structures, became clearly represented. We found the topography slope of previous DEMs was largely distorted in most of world major floodplains (e.g., Ganges, Nile, Niger, and Mekong) and swamp forests (e.g., Amazon, Congo, and Vasyugan). The newly developed DEM will enhance many geoscience applications which are terrain dependent.},

abstract = {Sea-level rise (SLR) from global warming may have severe consequences for coastal cities, particularly when combined with predicted increases in the strength of tidal surges. Predicting the regional impact of SLR flooding is strongly dependent on the modelling approach and accuracy of topographic data. Here, the areas under risk of sea water flooding for London boroughs were quantified based on the projected SLR scenarios reported in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fifth assessment report (AR5) and UK climatic projections 2009 (UKCP09) using a tidally-adjusted bathtub modelling approach. Medium- to very high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) are used to evaluate inundation extents as well as uncertainties. Depending on the SLR scenario and DEMs used, it is estimated that 3%-8% of the area of Greater London could be inundated by 2100. The boroughs with the largest areas at risk of flooding are Newham, Southwark, and Greenwich. The differences in inundation areas estimated from a digital terrain model and a digital surface model are much greater than the root mean square error differences observed between the two data types, which may be attributed to processing levels. Flood models from SRTM data underestimate the inundation extent, so their results may not be reliable for constructing flood risk maps. This analysis provides a broad-scale estimate of the potential consequences of SLR and uncertainties in the DEM-based bathtub type flood inundation modelling for London boroughs.},

The raster dataset has been generated by means of an advanced classification system which, for the first time, jointly exploits open-and-free optical and radar satellite imagery. The WSF2015 has been validated against 900,000 samples labelled by crowdsourcing photointerpretation of very high resolution Google Earth imagery and outperforms all other similar existing layers; in particular, it considerably improves the detection of very small settlements in rural regions and better outlines scattered suburban areas.

This is precisely what happened in the coastal state of Orissa, India. Individuals and communities living in regions where natural hazards are a part of daily life develop strategies to cope with and adapt to the impacts of extreme events. In October 1999, a cyclone killed 10,000 people according to government statistics, however, the unofficial death toll is much higher. This article examines why such a large loss of life occurred and looks at measures taken since then to initiate comprehensive disaster-preparedness programmes and to construct more cyclone shelters. The role of both governmental organisations and NGOs in this is critically analysed. The good news is that, based on an assessment of disaster preparedness during a small cyclone in November 2002, it can be seen that at community-level awareness was high and that many of the lessons learnt in 1999 were put into practice. Less positive, however, is the finding that at the state level collaboration continues to be problematic. {\textcopyright} Overseas Development Institute, 2004.},

After defining three aspects of counterfactuality and counterfact (dormant facts, reinterpreted facts, and rumor) and illustrating each in historical contexts, the author outlines their prognostic potential with specific reference to recent events whose differing interpretations have profound implications for future policy and international relations planning. Based on these examples, the author concludes that using counterfactual analysis as a method for developing scenarios and forecasting represents a useful approach toward coping with uncertainty and identifying wild cards, black swans, and so on. }

abstract = {India Meteorological Department has the responsibility of monitoring and prediction of cyclonic disturbances (CDs) including tropical cyclone (TC) and depression, collection, processing and archival of all data pertaining to CDs and preparation of best track data over the North Indian Ocean (NIO). The process of post-season analysis of CDs to determine the best estimate of a CD's position and intensity along with other characteristics during its lifetime is described as 'best tracking'. The best tracking procedure has undergone several changes world-over including NIO due to change in definition and classification of TCs, monitoring and analysis tools and procedure and physical understanding of TCs. There have been a few attempts to document the temporal changes in the best track procedure including changes in observational network, monitoring technique, area of responsibility for monitoring, terminology and classification of the TCs over the NIO. Hence, a study has been undertaken to review the temporal variations in all the above aspects of best tracking procedure and its impact on quality of best track parameters over the NIO. The problems and prospective with the best track data over the (NIO) have been presented and discussed. Based on quality and availability, the whole period of best track information may be broadly classified into four phases, viz. (i) pre-1877, (ii) 1877-1890, (iii) 1891-1960 and (iv) 1961-2010. The period of 1961-2010 may be further classified into (a) 1961-1973, (b) 1974-1990 and (c) 1991-2010. As optimum observational network including satellite leading to better estimation of location and intensity without missing of CDs was available since 1961, the climatology of genesis, location, intensity, movement (track) and landfall can be best represented based on the data set of 1961-2010. The best track parameters need to be reanalysed since 1891, based on the present criteria/classification of CDs to develop a digital data set of every six hourly position, intensity and other characteristics throughout the life period of each recorded CD over the NIO to meet the world standard. At least attempt should be made from 1974 when all types of major data including satellite, radar, surface and upper air observations are available for best track analysis. The reanalysis of best track parameters can help in better understanding and prediction of CDs and address the issues related to climate change aspects over the NIO region. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

There has been a greater realization by National and international community in the need for improving seismic safety of schools. The Department of Education (DOE) along the line of Flagship program of NRRC has developed a 5 year comprehensive plan for retrofitting of 900 school buildings of the Kathmandu Valley in 5 years and 60,000 buildings of the whole country in next 15 years. DOE has implemented retrofitting of 15 school buildings in 2010/2011 and another 50 buildings are being retrofitted through the support from NSET and ADB.

Schools represent a reference point for local communities and can be used as primary facilities for emergency and recovery activities after an earthquake. Focusing on the Nepal case, the last 2015 seismic events have shown that Nepalese school buildings are characterized by a high level of vulnerability. According to post-disaster surveys, more than the 20 percent of the country's classrooms experienced damage or collapse during the earthquake. Nepal's building stock is mainly constituted by non-engineered constructions realized without seismic detailing and material quality controls. Particularly, unreinforced masonry (URM) structures, representing the majority of the total building inventory, are characterized by numerous construction deficiencies such as inadequate wall-to-wall or wall-to-floor connections which have led to frequent out-of-plane collapses. Herein, a spectral-based methodology to derive fragility curves for Nepalese unreinforced masonry school buildings subjected to out-of-plane damage is discussed. The technique is applied to the case of typical mud-mortar URM Nepalese structures, by taking into account regional variations in construction practice, material properties and recurrent failure modes detected after the 2015 seismic events.},

However, the dominance of dystopian visions of irreversible environmental degradation and societal collapse, along with overly optimistic utopias and business-as-usual scenarios that lack insight and innovation, frustrate progress. Here, we present a novel approach to thinking about the future that builds on experiences drawn from a diversity of practices, worldviews, values, and regions that could accelerate the adoption of pathways to transformative change (change that goes beyond incremental improvements). Using an analysis of 100 initiatives, or “seeds of a good Anthropocene”, we find that emphasizing hopeful elements of existing practice offers the opportunity to: (1) understand the values and features that constitute a good Anthropocene, (2) determine the processes that lead to the emergence and growth of initiatives that fundamentally change human–environmental relationships, and (3) generate creative, bottom-up scenarios that feature well-articulated pathways toward a more positive future.},

   abstract = {There is a lot of rhetoric suggesting that disaster risk reduction (DRR) pays, yet surprisingly little in the way of hard facts. This review paper examines the evidence regarding the economic efficiency of DRM based on CBA. Specifically, it addresses the following questions: What can be said about current and best practice regarding CBA for DRR including limitations and alternatives? And, what, if at all, can be said in terms of quantitative insight for informing policy and practice? The review compares the documented evidence on the net benefits over a range of disaster management interventions, such as risk reduction, preparedness and risk financing. The review also critically discusses the applicability of cost?benefit analysis as well as other economic decision-supporting tools for assessing the efficiency of certain DRM interventions. Disaster risk is characterized by variability, which requires a risk-based assessment. As a key best practice criterion, and in order to avoid overestimating the benefits and returns on investment, the review focuses on studies that provide a risk-based estimate of benefits. This review shows that for the limited evidence reported the economic case for DRM across a range of hazards is strong and that the benefits of investing in DRM outweigh the costs of doing so on average, by about four times the cost in terms of avoided and reduced losses. In an age of austerity, cost?benefit analysis continues to be an important tool for prioritizing efficient DRM measures but with a shifting emphasis from infrastructure-based options (hard resilience) to preparedness and systemic interventions (soft resilience), other tools such as cost-effectiveness analysis, multi-criteria analysis and robust decision-making approaches deserve more attention.},

   abstract = {Some ways of budgeting for disasters have the potential to increase welfare by increasing national savings, reducing exposure to risk and promoting mitigation prior to a loss. Those ways can also contribute to aggregate fiscal stability over the long term. The power of budgeting, however, can be misdirected to increase losses and lead to fiscal instability. This paper describes the potential for gain from alternative budgetary treatments of policies aimed at reducing the effects on consumption of random shocks to income and wealth. It identifies a critical difference between alternatives: budgetary recognition of expected costs of relief and recovery before the loss event. We classify those different methods as ex ante and ex post budgeting. We also consider some budgetary mechanisms that can promote effective recognition and constrain opportunistic behaviour by elected officials. Finally, this paper describes related budgetary practices in some OECD countries. Many have instituted policies consistent with ex ante budgeting, but we have insufficient information to determine their effectiveness. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

   abstract = {Earthquakesare one of the most significant natural hazards in Nepal and there is a long history of destructive earthquakes in the region. Despite the risk of earthquake disasters, however, school construction practice in Nepal has largely ignored the issues of structural safety. Most schools are built without following proper design guidelines. As an effective tool to reduce earthquake disaster risk in the public schools of Nepal, the Public School Earthquake Safety Program was recently initiated in Nepal. In this program, more than 1000 public schools from six districts of Nepal were evaluated for earthquake safety, and various awareness raising and retrofitting programs were implemented. This paper describes the program features, extent of community participation, retrofitting processes and lessons learned while implementing the earthquake safety program. It also demonstrates how school earthquake safety programs ultimately increase the seismic safety of the entire community in the Himalayan regions. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

      <p>This paper evaluates the mitigation effect of Tokai earthquake measures on housing
         damage using a counterfactual approach. It focuses on those measures that stimulate
         ex‐ante investment in disaster prevention in the supposedly affected area, including
         earthquake‐proof retrofitting and improved housing construction; the effect of the
         measures on housing losses is estimated monetarily. The study compares factual disaster
         damage computed using a real distribution of houses with counterfactual damage to
         a hypothetical housing distribution that would occur if the measures were not implemented.
         The key findings are: (i) the disaster mitigation effects of Tokai earthquake measures
         on housing amount to approximately JPY 18 billion (USD 0.18 billion) for Yamanashi
         Prefecture and JPY 0.26 trillion (USD 2.6 billion) for Shizuoka Prefecture, which
         would be at the centre of the event; (ii) a before–after comparison biases estimates
         of the mitigation effect; and (iii) statistically, the measures do not mitigate the
         housing damage predicted for an earthquake in Tokai.

   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {Building collapse is the dominant cause of casualties during earthquakes. In order to better predict human fatalities, the U.S. Geological Survey's Prompt Assessment of Global Earthquakes for Response (PAGER) program requires collapse fragility functions for global building types. The collapse fragility is expressed as the probability of collapse at discrete levels of the input hazard defined in terms of macroseismic intensity. This article provides a simple procedure for quantifying collapse fragility using vulnerability criteria based on the European Macroseismic Scale (1998) for selected European building types. In addition, the collapse fragility functions are developed for global building types by fitting the beta distribution to the multiple experts' estimates for the same building type (obtained from EERI's World Housing Encyclopedia (WHE)- PAGER survey). Finally, using the collapse probability distributions at each shaking intensity level as a prior and field-based collapse-rate observations as likelihood, it is possible to update the collapse fragility functions for global building types using the Bayesian procedure. © 2011, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute.},

   abstract = {Gender and disaster risk reduction 2 Policy brief 3 imperative that disaster risk reduction and management strategies are gender-aware, taking into account both gender-based vulnerabilities as well as women's unique contributions. On average, disasters killed more than 70,000 people and affected more than 200 million people per year during the last decade in the Asia-Pacific region. 2 Climate-related disasters (e.g. storms, heavy rainfalls, floods, droughts, landslides, water stress and heatwaves), unplanned urban development, vulnerable livelihoods and ecosystem degradation could overturn years of progress made towards achieving sustainable development objectives and the Millennium Development Goals. 3 Almost 90 percent of deaths in disasters occur in hydro-meteorological events. 4 There is a mutually reinforcing relationship between climate change and disasters. Climate change increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather and climate events such as tropical cyclones, floods and heatwaves. 5 Further, the adverse impacts of climate change on livelihoods and ecosystems diminish communities' adaptive capacities and increase their vulnerability to disasters. 6 Gender-based vulnerability and exposure to disaster risk is clearly established Although all countries grapple with real and/or potential extreme hazards (e.g. earthquakes, tropical cyclones, floods), some are more vulnerable than others. The Asia-Pacific region, for example, accounted for 90 percent of countries affected by disasters, 65 percent of disaster related deaths and 38 percent of economic damage 7 —and climate change will likely intensify existing risk patterns in the region. 8 While disasters pose threats to lives and livelihoods of everyone in their path, they tend to have disparate impacts on particular demographics. This is Following the 1991 cyclone and flood in Bangladesh, women's death rate was almost five times higher than men's. Warning information was transmitted by men to men in public spaces, but was rarely communicated to the rest of the family. As many women are not allowed to leave the house without a male relative, they perished waiting for their relatives to return home and take them to a safe place. Moreover, as in many other Asian countries, most Bengali women have never learned to swim, which significantly reduced their survival chances during the flood.},

Counterfactual thinking (CFT), that is thinking about what might have happened, is linked to post‐traumatic stress. We studied the relationship between type and frequency of CFT and post‐traumatic stress in a sample of directly (n = 50) and indirectly exposed (n = 50) ministerial employees 4 years after the 2011 Oslo bombing. The results showed that frequency of CFT was associated with levels of post‐traumatic stress, among both directly and indirectly exposed participants. In the directly exposed group, self‐reported frequencies of downward counterfactuals were associated with post‐traumatic stress. A similar trend was found for upward counterfactuals. In the indirectly exposed group, self‐reported frequencies of both upward and downward counterfactuals were associated with higher levels of post‐traumatic stress. These results point to the intriguing possibility that people may not only develop post‐traumatic stress disorder as a result of actual experiences, but also via mental simulations of traumatic events that could have happened.

	title = {What Might Have Been: The Social Psychology of Counterfactual Thinking},
	isbn = {978-1-317-78047-2},
	abstract = {Within a few short years, research on counterfactual thinking has mushroomed, establishing itself as one of the signature domains within social psychology. Counterfactuals are thoughts of what might have been, of possible past outcomes that could have taken place. Counterfactuals and their implications for perceptions of time and causality have long fascinated philosophers, but only recently have social psychologists made them the focus of empirical inquiry. Following the publication of Kahneman and Tversky's seminal 1982 paper, a burgeoning literature has implicated counterfactual thinking in such diverse judgments as causation, blame, prediction, and suspicion; in such emotional experiences as regret, elation, disappointment and sympathy; and also in achievement, coping, and intergroup bias. But how do such thoughts come about? What are the mechanisms underlying their operation? How do their consequences benefit, or harm, the individual? When is their generation spontaneous and when is it strategic? This volume explores these and other numerous issues by assembling contributions from the most active researchers in this rapidly expanding subfield of social psychology. Each chapter provides an in-depth exploration of a particular conceptual facet of counterfactual thinking, reviewing previous work, describing ongoing, cutting-edge research, and offering novel theoretical analysis and synthesis. As the first edited volume to bring together the many threads of research and theory on counterfactual thinking, this book promises to be a source of insight and inspiration for years to come.},

The authors extend these findings by documenting a familiar occasion in which those who are objectively better off nonetheless feel worse. In particular, an analysis of the emotional reactions of bronze and silver medalists at the 1992 Summer Olympics—both at the conclusion of their events and on the medal stand—indicates that bronze medalists tend to be happier than silver medalists. The authors attribute these results to the fact that the most compelling counterfactual alternative for the silver medalist is winning the gold, whereas for the bronze medalist it is finishing without a medal. Support for this interpretation was obtained from the 1992 Olympics and the 1994 Empire State Games. The discussion focuses on the implications of endowment and contrast for well-being.

Reflecting on alternative pathways to pivotal turning points even produced greater meaning than directly reflecting on the meaning of the event itself. Fate perceptions ('it was meant to be') and benefit-finding (recognition of positive consequences) were identified as independent causal links between counterfactual thinking and the construction of meaning. Through counterfactual reflection, the upsides to reality are identified, a belief in fate emerges, and ultimately more meaning is derived from important life events.

We studied the relationship between type and frequency of CFT and post‐traumatic stress in a sample of directly (n = 50) and indirectly exposed (n = 50) ministerial employees 4 years after the 2011 Oslo bombing. The results showed that frequency of CFT was associated with levels of post‐traumatic stress, among both directly and indirectly exposed participants. In the directly exposed group, self‐reported frequencies of downward counterfactuals were associated with post‐traumatic stress. A similar trend was found for upward counterfactuals. In the indirectly exposed group, self‐reported frequencies of both upward and downward counterfactuals were associated with higher levels of post‐traumatic stress. These results point to the intriguing possibility that people may not only develop post‐traumatic stress disorder as a result of actual experiences, but also via mental simulations of traumatic events that could have happened.

In our reexamination, we found that people’s beliefs are consistent with their decisions, but they do not necessarily correspond with the environment. Both overestimation and underweighting of the rare event seemed to result from (most, but not all) participants’ mistaken belief that they can infer and exploit sequential patterns in a static environment. In addition, we found that such inaccurate representations can be improved through incentives. Finally, detailed analysis suggested a mixture of individual-level response patterns, which can give rise to an erroneous interpretation of group-level patterns. Our results offer an explanation for why beliefs and decisions can appear contradictory and present challenges to some current models of decisions under uncertainty.

	abstract = {It should come as no surprise that the governments and citizenries of many countries show little concern about climate change and its consequences. Behavioral decision research over the last 30 years provides a series of lessons about the importance of affect in perceptions of risk and in decisions to take actions that reduce or manage perceived risks. Evidence from a range of domains suggests that worry drives risk management decisions. When people fail to be alarmed about a risk or hazard, they do not take precautions. Recent personal experience strongly influences the evaluation of a risky option. Low-probability events generate less concern than their probability warrants on average, but more concern than they deserve in those rare instances when they do occur. Personal experience with noticeable and serious consequences of global warming is still rare in many regions of the world. When people base their decisions on statistical descriptions about a hazard provided by others, characteristics of the hazard identified as psychological risk dimensions predict differences in alarm or worry across different classes of risk. The time-delayed, abstract, and often statistical nature of the risks of global warming does not evoke strong visceral reactions. These results suggest that we should find ways to evoke visceral reactions towards the risk of global warming, perhaps by simulations of its concrete future consequences for people's home or other regions they visit or value. Increased concern about global warming needs to solicited carefully, however, to prevent a decrease in concern about other relevant risks. The generation of worry or concern about global warming may be a necessary but not sufficient condition for desirable or appropriate protective or mitigating behavior on part of the general public.},

	abstract = {This article reviews the main insights from selected literature on risk perception, particularly in connection with natural hazards. It includes numerous case studies on perception and social behavior dealing with floods, droughts, earthquakes, volcano eruptions, wild fires, and landslides. The review reveals that personal experience of a natural hazard and trust—or lack of trust—in authorities and experts have the most substantial impact on risk perception. Cultural and individual factors such as media coverage, age, gender, education, income, social status, and others do not play such an important role but act as mediators or amplifiers of the main causal connections between experience, trust, perception, and preparedness to take protective actions. When analyzing the factors of experience and trust on risk perception and on the likeliness of individuals to take preparedness action, the review found that a risk perception paradox exists in that it is assumed that high risk perception will lead to personal preparedness and, in the next step, to risk mitigation behavior. However, this is not necessarily true. In fact, the opposite can occur if individuals with high risk perception still choose not to personally prepare themselves in the face of a natural hazard. Therefore, based on the results of the review, this article offers three explanations suggesting why this paradox might occur. These findings have implications for future risk governance and communication as well as for the willingness of individuals to invest in risk preparedness or risk mitigation actions.},

	abstract = {Natural disasters may increase in frequency and severity in the future as a result of climate change, which is likely to have an impact on the demand for natural disaster insurance. Insights about individual risk beliefs and behavioural responses to changing risks are relevant for insurers, as it allows them, for example, to estimate the demand for new insurance products that cover weather-related damage. This study elicits individual risk beliefs and the demand for low-probability, high-impact flood insurance using the contingent valuation survey method among approximately 1000 homeowners in the Dutch river delta. This study is of practical relevance since currently flood insurance is not available in the Netherlands, while insurers have been considering to provide such insurance. Individuals generally do not behave in accordance with the expected utility model since a significant proportion of homeowners neglect the low-probability flood risk. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) of those individuals who demand flood insurance is on average considerably higher than the expected value of the flood risk they face. Moreover, the WTP for flood insurance is less than proportionally related to increased flood probabilities that were presented to respondents in the questionnaire. Individuals follow a process of Bayesian updating of flood probabilities, since perceptions of flood risk are an important determinant of the WTP, while objective risks derived from geographical characteristics influence the WTP to a lesser extent. Communication of baseline probabilities and changes in flood probabilities using risk ladders facilitate the comprehension of risk by respondents, and has a considerable effect on the level of the WTP and its sensitivity to probability changes. The results indicate that the current ex post public compensation scheme of flood damage lowers demand for private insurance.},

In general, availability is correlated with ecological frequency, but it is also affected by other factors. Consequently, the reliance on the availability heuristic leads to systematic biases. Such biases are demonstrated in the judged frequency of classes of words, of combinatorial outcomes, and of repeated events. The phenomenon of illusory correlation is explained as an availability bias. The effects of the availability of incidents and scenarios on subjective probability are discussed.},

For such decisions, people can call only on their own encounters with such prospects, making decisions from experience. Decisions from experience and decisions from description can lead to dramatically different choice behavior. In the case of decisions from description, people make choices as if they overweight the probability of rare events, as described by prospect theory. We found that in the case of decisions from experience, in contrast, people make choices as if they underweight the probability of rare events, and we explored the impact of two possible causes of this underweighting—reliance on relatively small samples of information and overweighting of recently sampled information.

This article provides an updated account of the functional theory of counterfactual thinking, suggesting that such thoughts are best explained in terms of their role in behavior regulation and performance improvement. The article reviews a wide range of cognitive experiments indicating that counterfactual thoughts may influence behavior by either of two routes: a content-specific pathway (which involves specific informational effects on behavioral intentions, which then influence behavior) and a content-neutral pathway (which involves indirect effects via affect, mind-sets, or motivation). The functional theory is particularly useful in organizing recent findings regarding counterfactual thinking and mental health. The article concludes by considering the connections to other theoretical conceptions, especially recent advances in goal cognition.},

	abstract = {Natural disaster risk assessments typically consider environmental hazard and physical damage, neglecting to quantify how asset losses affect households’ well-being. However, for a given asset loss, a wealthy household might quickly recover, while a poor household might suffer major, long-lasting impacts. This research proposes a methodology to quantify disaster impacts more equitably by integrating the three pillars of sustainability: environmental (hazard and asset damage), economic (macro-economic changes in production and employment) and social (disaster recovery at the household level). The model innovates by assessing the impacts of disasters on people’s consumption, considering asset losses and changes in income, among other factors. We apply the model to a hypothetical earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area, considering the differential impact of consumption loss on households of varying wealth. The analysis reveals that poorer households suffer 19\% of the asset losses but 41\% of the well-being losses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of specific policies varies across cities (depending on their built environment and social and economic profiles) and income groups.},

    abstract = { A changing climate may increase the frequency or intensity of natural hazards, resulting in increased infrastructure damage. The paper will describe how risk-based approaches are well suited to optimising climate adaptation strategies related to the construction, design, operation, and maintenance of built infrastructure. Climate adaptation engineering involves estimating the risks, costs, and benefits of climate adaptation strategies and assessing at what point in time climate adaptation becomes economically viable. Stochastic methods are used to model infrastructure performance, risk reduction, and effectiveness of adaptation strategies, exposure, and costs. These concepts will be illustrated with recent research on risk-based life-cycle assessments of climate adaptation strategies for Australian housing subject to extreme wind events. This will pave the way for more efficient and resilient infrastructure, and help future proof new and existing infrastructure to a changing climate. }

	abstract = {Land-use change models are typically calibrated to reproduce known historic changes. Calibration results can then be assessed by comparing two datasets: the simulated land-use map and the actual land-use map at the same time. A common method for this is the Kappa statistic, which expresses the agreement between two categorical datasets corrected for the expected agreement. This expected agreement is based on a stochastic model of random allocation given the distribution of class sizes. However, when a model starts from an initial land-use map and makes changes to it, that stochastic model does not pose a meaningful reference level. This paper introduces {KSimulation}, a statistic that is identical in form to the Kappa statistic but instead applies a more appropriate stochastic model of random allocation of class transitions relative to the initial map. The new method is illustrated on a simple example and then the results of the Kappa statistic and {KSimulation} are compared using the results of a land-use model. It is found that only {KSimulation} truly tests models in their capacity to explain land-use changes over time, and unlike Kappa it does not inflate results for simulations where little change takes place over time. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Conservation related to the water sector is desired mainly in relation to water supply \& groundwater management, pollutant emissions, flood/drainage management, and preservation of green areas. Major options are associated with options in spatial planning for the region. An integration of water resources development planning and spatial/regional planning is desired. This requires appropriate institutions, planning procedures, cooperation between actors, regulations, and financing. In particular cost-recovery and cost \& benefit sharing will be important components to reach overall conservation objectives in a decentralized context (a.o. three provinces).},
